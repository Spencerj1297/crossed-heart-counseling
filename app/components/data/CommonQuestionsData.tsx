      answer:
        "The more flexible you can be, the easier it will be to get an appointment quickly. Most people want late-afternoon and/or early evening appointments, so the demand for these appointments is extremely high. Frequency of counseling will need to be determined after your first appointment. On average, most clients schedule appointments 2-4 times per month. Many clients come more frequently when starting counseling, then less frequently as they begin to see positive changes and results.",
