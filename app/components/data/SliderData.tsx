        "I was looking for a women's support group for marital infidelity and found Laura's Survive and Thrive group... oh thank goodness it was just what I needed! The group was informative, supportive and healing for me. Laura's workbook toughed on so many wounds I was experiencing and provided hope and healing for me. Getting to know the other women in the group was also such a blessing for me. It was a place where we could laugh, cry and trust. Laura really nurtured a safe and supportive environment, allowing each one of us to grieve and process at our own pace. It made all the difference for me. Thank you Laura!",

        "My husband and I came to Laura about three years ago as a last resort before divorcing. We had been to several other counselors with no resolution, they didn't seem to know how to help us; we were dealing with my husbands multiple affairs and porn. Laura had a unique plan and strategy that made sense and was in line with our Christian faith. We wouldn't be where we are today without her help, expertise and insight.",

        "We began working with Laura about 18 months ago. At that time, we were on the verge of filing for a divorce, however felt an immediate sense of hope by the end of our first session. Since that time, so much growth and healing has happened thanks to Laura's gentle yet firm guidance, her unique understanding and insight into our situation, and most of all, her focus and direction on helping us develop a stronger relationship with God. We are so grateful we found Laura when we did, our family is whole and better than ever would have been possible.",

        "I was referred to Laura by a friend at a time when I was feeling hopeless. I had just found out my spouse has been unfaithful to me for years and I didn't know where to turn. Laura has an amazing ability to understand and help. After a few sessions, my husband agreed to join me in counseling (thank God) and we are working through the infidelity and are building a stronger foundation with God in the center. I would highly recommend Laura for any issue you have; she is wonderful!",
